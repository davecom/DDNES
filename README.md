# DDNES
DDNES is a very primitive NES emulator. This is a personal learning project for me that I don't expect to be especially useful to anyone else. As I have time, I'm implementing an NES emulator in C with SDL. I'm doing this through a combination of my own code, information from the guides at [nesdev.com](https://www.nesdev.com/), various bits and pieces of documentation all over the Web, and porting parts of (especially the PPU background rendering) [Michael Fogleman's excellent Go NES emulator](https://github.com/fogleman/nes). I'm not being a purist about thisâ€”I am looking at other people's code as I get stuck. Right now the 6502 CPU core seems to be working pretty well and the PPU (picture processing unit) can display basic backgrounds and sprites. At present, it can play the games Donkey Kong and Tennis pretty much correctly, albeit with no sound.

This will never be anything impressive, and it's not code I'm proud of... it's more of a hack as I have time. If you want to look at good code, please checkout Michael's project. I just plan to get Donkey Kong working and call it a day. I've learned a lot about the 6502 and NES architecture already and when I get Donkey Kong playing decently I will have achieved my learning objectives for this project.

## Building

If for some very strange reason you wanted to build this code for this non-working emulator, it comes bundled as a project for Xcode 10 w/ SDL included in this repository. Although the code is technically probably cross-platform there are no build scripts beyond the Xcode project. It takes the file containing the game to play as the single command-line argument, which is specified in Xcode's Scheme configuration window. Right now only Mapper 0 is implemented.
