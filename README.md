# DDNES
This is a personal learning project for me that I don't expect to be especially useful to anyone else. As I have time, I'm implementing an NES emulator in C with SDL. I'm doing this through a combination of my own code, information from the guides at [nesdev.com](https://www.nesdev.com/), various bits and pieces of documentation all over the Web, and porting parts of (especially the PPU) [Michael Fogleman's excellent Go NES emulator](https://github.com/fogleman/nes). I'm not being a purist about thisâ€”I am looking at other people's code as I get stuck. Right now the 6502 CPU core seems to be working pretty well and the PPU (picture processing unit) can display basic backgrounds (although not quite correctly!).

This will never be anything impressive, and it's not code I'm proud of... it's more of a hack as I have time. If you want to look at good code, please checkout Michael's project. I just plan to get Donkey Kong working and call it a day. I've learned a lot about the 6502 and NES architecture already and when I get Donkey Kong playing decently I will have achieved my learning objectives for this project.

## To-Do
- [X] Memory Map
- [X] CPU Core
- [X] Basic PPU Background Rendering
- [ ] Correct Background Rendering
- [ ] Sprites
- [ ] Controller Support through keyboard
- [ ] Playable Donkey Kong
- [ ] APU (Audio Processing Unit)... maybe... eh would be pretty happy with the above
